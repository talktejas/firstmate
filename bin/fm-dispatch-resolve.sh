#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-dispatch-resolve.sh - resolve one concrete crewmate or scout dispatch
# profile from a task brief with typesafe.ai's System One model (Jev), opt-in.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-dispatch-resolve.sh <brief-file> [--project <name>]
#
# Opt-in gate: TYPESAFE_API_KEY non-empty in this process environment, else a
#   TYPESAFE_API_KEY= line in $FM_HOME/.env read with fmx_env_get, the same
#   accessor as FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN (bin/fm-env-lib.sh). The environment wins.
#   Absent in both: one "dispatch-resolve: off" line on stderr, nothing on
#   stdout, exit 0, no network call, so firstmate dispatches exactly as today.
#   bin/fm-jev-lib.sh owns the key handling, the request, and the answer
#   validation; this tool owns everything decided from the answer.
#
# What it does when on with at least one rule: one POST to
#   https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone with the project name and the brief's
#   `## Captain's intent` and `## Firstmate spec` sections, tagged when it is a
#   scout brief (the whole brief when it has neither section), as state and
#   ONE Choice question whose options are every rule's `when` from
#   config/crew-dispatch.json plus one fixed generic none option. Jev returns
#   the matched rule, a probability per option, and a confidence. Everything
#   after that is jq: the confidence floor (0.6 on the answer confidence, or a
#   rule's declared `min_confidence` on that rule's probability, falling to the
#   most probable other option that clears its own floor), the rule's declared
#   `approval` and `floor`, each profile's declared `provider` and `floor`, the
#   quota rows from ONE quota-axi --json snapshot (schema 5 or 6; each
#   candidate binds to one row through quota_row in
#   bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh, so a Pi lane such as openai-codex-work/...
#   reads its own account's row and an expanded provider with no row for the
#   candidate is unmeasured, never blocked), and the spendPriority argmax over
#   the eligible candidates. The model never sees quota, catalogs, approvals,
#   confidence floors, `why`, or `use`. With no rules, it returns a non-clear
#   result so firstmate keeps using the existing intake.
#   docs/configuration.md "Crew dispatch profiles" owns the declared fields and
#   "Typed dispatch resolution" owns this tool's operator contract.
#
# Never-send check: when the optional $FM_HOME/config/dispatch-never-send list
#   exists, every string value of the built request is checked against it
#   before the POST. Each non-blank, non-# line is a literal matched
#   case-insensitively, with surrounding whitespace trimmed and every run of
#   whitespace, on both sides, treated as one space. A match, or a list that
#   is not a readable regular file, prints one
#   "dispatch-resolve: off (...; nothing sent)" line on stderr naming at most
#   the list line number, never its value, prints nothing on stdout, and exits
#   0 with no network or quota call, exactly like the absent-key off path.
#
# Output (stdout, TOON-style block):
#   dispatch-resolve:
#     status: clear | ambiguous | escalate | error
#     model/latency_ms/tokens, rule (when excerpt) and confidence, probabilities
#     fallback: <runner-up rule taken when the picked rule missed its own floor>
#     reason: <why the status is not clear>
#     candidate: <harness>:<model> provider=.. scope=.. remaining=..% spendPriority=.. runway=.. -> eligible | eligible, unranked: <reason> | not eligible: <reason>
#     profile: --harness <h> [--model <m>] [--effort <e>]     (status clear only)
#   clear     -> pass the profile line to fm-spawn.sh unless you state a reason to override
#   ambiguous -> confidence below the floor; decide as today from the probabilities
#   escalate  -> the rule requires captain approval, no candidate is rankable, or a genuine tie
#   error     -> API, network, response, or quota-axi failure; decide as today
#   Every outcome exits 0 so an intake is never blocked by this tool.
#   Exit 2 only for a usage or configuration error (unreadable brief, an
#   existing unreadable rules file, malformed rules, or missing jq), which is
#   actionable, never selected around.
#
# Record: every outcome after the gate appends one JSON line (time, project,
#   digest of the state sent or null when no request was made, status, chosen
#   rule, confidence, each answer and its confidence, profile) to $FM_HOME/state/.dispatch-resolve.log, mode 0600,
#   cut back to its newest 1000 lines past 256 KiB. It holds no brief text and
#   no key, and a failed write never changes the outcome.
#
# Environment:
#   TYPESAFE_API_KEY is the only resolver-specific environment setting.
#
# Authority: this tool never replaces firstmate's judgment, quota-array-dispatch,
#   the captain-approval gate, or fm-spawn.sh validation; it publishes one
#   inspectable answer plus every candidate's evidence, in code.
